==IMPORTANT==
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and has very few features at the moment.
You are free to contribute features if you wish though!

==Description==
At the moment, libPapyrus_Decoder_Test.py is hard coded.
To use it, make sure to change the path to your fallout 4 root folder.

Planned features:
• Python to Pex compiler
• Pex to Python decompiler
• Pex parser

==How do I get the scripts?==
Due to legal reasons, I cannot redistribute the offical bethesda pex files.
You will need to unpack them from "Fallout 4 - misc.ba2".

You can get a tool that does this at http://f4se.silverlock.org/

==Contribution notice==
'''DO NOT INCLUDE PEX FILES FROM BETHESDA'''
This INCLUDES decompiled pex files, even if they are in .py format.

Additionally, do not push __pycache__/ directories.
This is in the .gitignore in this repo.
